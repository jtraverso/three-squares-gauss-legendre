# Mathlib definitions used in ThreeSquaresChallenge.lean

Verbatim excerpts of the Mathlib definitions used by the statements in `ThreeSquaresChallenge.lean`, at the
pinned Mathlib revision `c55e6e786f49471c72fbddbec5415808896aec1e` (tag `v4.35.0-rc3`, repository
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4). Mathlib is released under the Apache-2.0
licence. Each excerpt gives the file and line at that revision; the complete source is at
`https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/c55e6e786f49471c72fbddbec5415808896aec1e/<file>`.

These excerpts are provided so that the meaning of every imported notion used by the
Challenge can be audited without fetching Mathlib. `Nat`, `Int`, `Fin`, `%` and `^` are from the Lean core library.

## Finset.prod / Finset.sum (notation `∑ i, f i`, the additive version via `to_additive`)

`Mathlib/Algebra/BigOperators/Group/Finset/Defs.lean`, line 68:

```lean

  (s.1.map f).prod

## Fintype

`Mathlib/Data/Fintype/Defs.lean`, line 53:

```lean
/-- `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
  finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
  is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
  together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. -/
class Fintype (α : Type*) where
  /-- The `Finset` containing all elements of a `Fintype` -/
  elems : Finset α
  /-- A proof that `elems` contains every element of the type -/
  complete : ∀ x : α, x ∈ elems
```

## Finset.univ

`Mathlib/Data/Fintype/Defs.lean`, line 90:

```lean
/-- `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
  the assumption `Fintype α`. -/
def univ : Finset α :=
  @Fintype.elems α _
