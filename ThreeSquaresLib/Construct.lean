# A unimodular form representing `n`

`sum_three_sq_of_dvd`: if `a ≥ 1`, `d = a n − 1 > 0` and `d ∣ 1 + n b²`, then with
`c = (1 + n b²) / d` the matrix `[[a, b, 1], [b, c, 0], [1, 0, n]]` is positive definite of
determinant `1` (`a d q(x, y, z) = d (a x + b y + z)² + a y² + (b y − d z)²`), so its diagonal entry
`n` is a sum of three squares (`sum_three_sq_of_unimodular`).
