# Positive definite unimodular ternary forms

`exists_eq_transpose_mul`: a positive definite integral ternary quadratic form of determinant `1` is
equivalent to `x² + y² + z²`, i.e. its matrix is `Pᵀ P` for an integer matrix `P`. A vector `v₁`
with `q(v₁) = 1` exists by `exists_qf_lt_two`; applied to the form `q(x) + B(v₁, x)²` (determinant
`2`) it gives `v₂` with `q(v₂) = 1` and `B(v₁, v₂) = 0`; the vector `w = adj(A) (v₁ × v₂)` completes
an orthonormal basis.
